# Tableau-BC-Education-Data
This project's purpose is to create effective visualizations to provide insight to the pattern of international students and international tuition across public post-secondary institutions in British Columbia (BC). The goal is to present information in a way that it informs both policy makers in BCâ€™s Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training and international students who aspire to study at public postsecondary institutions in BC.<br><br>
